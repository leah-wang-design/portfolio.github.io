            <h4>Do you find it challenging to find something fun to do without spending hours Googling and browsing websites? You are not the only one who feels this way - searching for trending events often requires users to use many different online sources
                such as Google, Eventbrite, Facebook Event, Instagram, etc. Besides, users need to use map apps, ticket apps, time and dates, etc., for checking details of the events or places. This process is time-consuming, laborious, and it can be
                very frustrating for many people.

                <br><br> I learned 1) There are many ways for the back-end developers to collect event data through APIs and web scraping techniques, so the app doesn't necessarily rely on event organizers;
                <br> 2) There are two types of typical users I need to consider in the design process: users who like to plan and people looking for things they can do right away.

            <h4>I also conducted competitive studies on the most used app related to fun-discovery, including Google Map, Facebook Event, Facebook Local, Yelp, Eventbrite, Snap Map. Among all the apps mentioned, Facebook events and Facebook local are the
                most ideal ones to use when users are not looking for anything specific but fun stuff they can do to get out of their houses. (Note: Facebook Local app was no longer available since Jan 2021 after this research was conducted)</h4>

                with event findings. The general user flow was easy to understand, but I got questioned very often on the 'List' tab after they switched from the 'Map' tab. When users are on the list page, they got confused because are not sure about
                the differences between the result on the 'list' page and 'map' page. </h4>
