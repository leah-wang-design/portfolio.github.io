            <h4>I began the process by interviewing friends on their experience with current music app they are using and painpoints they have. I went through the user interactions within the major music apps (spotify,apple music, youtube music, soundcloud)

                of competitors in this market, itâ€™s important to think about something original in design so that the service can stand out from the crowd. I did a competitive study for the major music players in the market, in order to get a sense of
                what kind of functions exist and the potentials to explore out of music app.</h4>

            <h4>For music players like Spotify, Youtube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Tidal, though the general services they provide are all similar (includes Explore music, personalized recommendation, search music, add music to playlist, customize
                playlist), they all have their own star features that help them stand out in the market, such as strong searching options, options to show lyrics, integration with youtube, integration with Alexa, and options to choose music quality and

            <h4>I sketched different <a href="Musicplayer/Diagram/5_DifferentPagesSketchIterations.png">versions</a> for each interface, after self-critizing for the first round and getting feedback from friends, I was able to come to a cleaner and better-organized

            <h4>One idea I came up with is using 'mood' to label the song and categorize the song to different playlists. In order to validate the idea, I conducted research on the major music apps, and found 'genre' and 'mood' currently are the most important
                influencers when choosing music to listen to, yet the terms to define 'mood'and 'genre' are often mixed, sometimes can be ambiguous and misleading. As a starting point, I referred to the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/eeseniordesignhandbook/2015/music-mood-classification/">report</a>                Tufts University did to classify the music mood, and came up with 10 moods to label the music.</h4>
            <img src="Musicplayer/Diagram/7_emoticons.png" alt="emoticons">
            <h4>I also sketched different versions of logo for the app. The main idea is having a logo that tells people about the app's key feature 'integration of music and moods'. After showing different options to my friends and mentor, I narrowed down
                the options to two, and combined them to a logo that has a vibe of a person listening to music and has a smile on its face.</h4>
