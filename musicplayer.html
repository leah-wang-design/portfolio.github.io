            <h4>I began the process by interviewing friends on their experience with current music app they are using and painpoints they have. I went through the user interactions within the major music apps (spotify,apple music, youtube music, soundcloud)

            <h4>Music is an integral part of human life, but at the same time, that is not the sphere where people would like to make any additional efforts. Everything the user needs here is clear navigation and fast work. However, considering the number
                of competitors in this market, itâ€™s important to think about something original in design so that the service can stand out from the crowd. I did a competitive study for the major music players in the market, in order to get a sense of
                what kind of functions exist and the potentials to explore out of music app.</h4>
            <img src="Musicplayer/Diagram/0_musicapplogos.png" alt="competitivestudypng">
            <h4>For music players like Spotify, Youtube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Tidal, though the general services they provide are all similar (includes Explore music, personalized recommendation, search music, add music to playlist, customize
                playlist), they all have their own star features that help them stand out in the market, such as strong searching options, options to show lyrics, integration with youtube, integration with Alexa, and options to choose music quality and
                find new songs based on music genres.</h4>
            <li class="subtitle">Understand the Users</li>
            <h4>In order to get a better understanding of the users, I looked through comments in app store for the major music apps above. And I interviewed six friends who are daily users of apple music, spotify or youtube music.</h4>

            <h5>Some quotes from the users</h5><br><br>
            <h4>Based on the research, I found 'finding music' and 'organizing music' are the most common complaints from the users. Users found it sometimes challenging to find the ones they want to listen to, and it's a pain to organize the playlists if
                they have a lot of songs.</h4>

                share similar music tastes with her.<br></h4>

            <h4>By sketching mindmap, I started to brainstorm as many as ideas I can, and pick the solutions that are more innovative and potentials to be developed further.</h4>
            <h4>One idea I came up with is using 'mood' to label the song and categorize the song to different playlists. In order to validate the idea, I conducted research on the major music apps, and found 'genre' and 'mood' currently are the most important
                influencers when choosing music to listen to, yet the terms to define 'mood'and 'genre' are often mixed, sometimes can be ambiguous and misleading. As a starting point, I referred to the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/eeseniordesignhandbook/2015/music-mood-classification/">report</a>                Tufts University did to classify the music mood, and came up with 10 moods to label the music.</h4>

                the options to two, and combined them to a logo that has a vibe of a person listening to music and has a smile on its face.</h4>
