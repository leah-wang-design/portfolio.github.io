            <li>Step 1: Understand the problems</li>
            <h4>As the first step, we conducted primary research and secondary research to learn more about remote teaching for kids in the current market. Keeping kids focused and engaged during online classes was the most common concern from the teachers
                and parents.
                <br>
                <br> We also went through major online-teaching-related platforms and apps and did a competitive study. We realized that although there are many apps for video calls and teaching (among which the most widely used are Teams and Google Classroom),
                few of them focused on making the teaching experience easy and straightforward for elementary school teachers and students.</h4>
            <li class="subtitle">Surveys and interviews:</li>
            <h4>We designed and distributed the questionnaires to the teachers in Broward county public schools to have a deeper understanding of the challenges they have. And we interviewed five teachers to learn how they engage with students and gain attention
                from the kids during in-person teaching.
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h4>Among the 37 respondents we received,</h4>

            <h3>
                <span style="color:#E17247">33%</span> of participants think the current teaching software they are using has not met their needs and needs improvement.</h3>
            <h3><span style="color:#E17247">56%</span> of participants got frustrated the most during online teaching because they are not able to see the kids and give timely feedback when the students need help</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Here are some quotes from the respondents:</h4>

            <h4>We concluded two main pain points from the teachers:</h4><br>
            <h4>1. It's hard to interact, engage with, and get timely feedback from the kids
            </h4>
            <h4>2. It's hard to make kids stay focus during the classes</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Based on the pain points, we defined the following <b>user stories</b> as the most critical ones for our study:</h4>

            <li class="subtitle">Home page: How to start a class quickly?</li>
            <h4>Since the app is for elementary school students and teachers, the interfaces must be straightforward and easily learnable.
                <br><br>The first decision to make is how do we help teachers and students start a class quickly:</h4>
            <img src="onlineteaching/Diagram/2_Wireframesforhomepage.png" alt="Wireframesforhomepage" data-aos="fade-zoom-in" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-easing="ease-in-back">

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Among different versions of the home page, I decided to pick the one with the navigation bar on the left and the quick access to the classes at the center. We also validated this idea in the user testings sessions to make sure that teachers
                prefer to start the course right away when they use the app.</h4>
            <li class="subtitle">How do we encourage students to show their faces during the classes?</li>
            <h4>Another complaint from teachers about online teaching is that some students don't want to show their faces, and the teachers can't get immediate feedback from their gestures and reactions.
                <br>
                <br><i style="font-weight:300;">'They joined the meeting, turned off the camera, and leave so they don't participate in the class.'</i> <br><br> We need to find a way to encourage the students to turn on their cameras and better engage
                with the classes. With the help of up-front secondary research we conducted, the team decided to create a virtual classroom feature for the app. The idea is to simulate the real scenario of students in the classroom by having everyone
                'sit' on the desk and have their faces showing up on a cartoon body. The student who doesn't have their camera on will have a blank camera view. It aims to 'gamify' online class taking and encourage the kids to turn on their cameras.
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h4>I experimented with a few options including: </h4>

            <br>
            <h4>I picked option3 and option4 as the final options and brought them to discuss with the team. The team chose option3 to get tested since it's neat and straightforward and can accommodate a reasonable amount of students. (there are usually 10-15
                students in the class in Broward public schools)</h4>
            <li class="subtitle">Optimize the layouts</li>
            <h4>Presentation mode is a big part of online teaching and also where a lot of complaints arose. Teachers want to see the students' faces while presenting - after all, the most important thing for them is confirming the kids understand the information
                they are delivering. <br><br>How do we show the presentation and students' videos at the same time? Considering the compatibility with Google slides, we use 4:3 and 16:9 as width to height ratios for the presentation area to try out different
                layout options.</h4>

                still being the focal point. It also utilizes the space efficiently without being too packed or empty, and it provides the teachers the flexibility to move around their camera view.

                one of the most common ways teachers can achieve that is by observing students' reactions and calling up kids to answer questions.</h4>

            <h4>Before we moved onto the high-fidelity design, we made a prototype with different solutions we had in wireframe by using Figma. And we designed and conducted unmoderated user testings through Maze. From the seven responses we gathered, we
                were able to get some valuable feedback and insights: </h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>1)More than 85% of people thought the interface is very easy to navigate and kid-friendly.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>
                    "I think the usability is better than Zoom since all the features are in a single location.'
                    <br>
                    "The page setup looks very clean and kids friendly . "</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>2) More than 50% of people thought the features make their teaching process engaging and fun.</b> <br><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>3) They like the reaction feature, but there's room for improvement. </b><br><br><i>"Liked the emoji reactions better than Teams and Zoom, it's easy to use, and kids will like it!"</i> <br><br><i>"I like the reaction feature, but I think the button should remain on the toolbar and not move directly to the pinned speaker. It looked as if the reaction was on the speaker."</i>                <br><br><br>
                <br><b>4) They love the feature that allows them to put students at the center of the screen.</b><br><br><i>"Clicking the student to make them show on the center screen - what an awesome and easy-to-use feature!"<br><br>"I liked the ability to pin multiple students. It would be super helpful for class discussions."<br><br> "The best part is to be able to choose to have a student or two appear on the center screen."</i>                <br><br><br>
                <br><b>5) Though some of the ways users are doing now are different from what they are used to in other video call app (e.g.: Teams, Google Meeting), they found it intuitive and make sense.</b><i><br><br> "I didn't realize that I need to click the little X in the upper right corner to go back to the slideshow. I thought that I would have to click the switch screen icon on the bottom. Once I realized I could click
                    the X, it seemed pretty user-friendly."</i>

            <li>Step 5: High-fidelity</li>
            <h4>With the feedback we gathered, I modified the design and created high-fidelity interfaces. The overall user flow stays the same as the wireframes. I used bright colors and animations to make the user experience more fun and engaging. </h4>

            <h4>Although I had no domain knowledge of the topic (teaching kids), research thoroughly on the product and users and gaining insights from users helped me carry out the design professionally within a short time. It was also great to collaborate
                with other designers and researchers. I learned a lot from different perspectives, honed the skill of articulating my design ideas and presenting them to other designers.


                <br><br>Based on our research, the overall user flow works well, and the team was pleased about it. We also wanted to continue to work on the 'reaction' feature to make it more fun and kid-friendly. We also spent some time designing the
                student version of the app - it's similar to the teacher's version but simplified and has fewer buttons they need to click. The next steps for the team would be to test the new version of the app with students and kids to gain valuable
                insight and continue iterating for an even more engaging experience.</h4>
