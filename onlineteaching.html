            <h4>As the first step, we conducted research to learn more about remote teaching for kids in the current market. By analyzing the results we collected through research and interviews, we learned that keeping students focused and engaged during
                online classes was the most common concern from the teachers and parents.

            <h4>
                We went through major online-teaching-related platforms and apps and did competitive studies. We realized that although there are many apps for video calls and teaching (among which the most widely used are Teams and Google Classroom),

            <h4>By conducting qualitative research and quantities through surveys and interviews with the teachers, we gained valuable insights regarding their challenges and needs. We also got inspired by how they teach during in-person teaching -we can
                adopt some of the methods teachers used and help them achieve the same thing by using the teaching app.

                <br><br> <span class="highlight">We got a general idea of what we want to build to help achieve the goals by presenting our ideas to each other and realized there was some critical information we needed to gather from the users before proceeding:</span>
                <br><br>1) Is it necessary to show all the students' cameras while the teachers presenting the slides?
                <br> 2) Is the chatting function frequently used during the classes? Do users prefer chatting over showing reactions to interact?
                <br> 3) What are the most used features for the users during the classes?
                <br>
                <br> We provided the questions to the user researchers to conduct another round of interviews. We learned that:<br><br>1)The chatting features are not often used during the classes; <br>2)Teachers do want to see the students while teaching;
                <br>3)They often use the whiteboard and mute/unmute features during the classes;<br> 4)They wish they could have more ways to organize group discussions such as random call students, breakout rooms, etc. <br><br>Based on the results and
                our judgments, we decided on the key features to work on. I will be focusing mainly on the design of the homepage, teaching modes, and reaction features for the later tasks.

            <br>
            <h4>Among different versions of the homepage, I decided to pick the one with the navigation bar on the left and the quick access to the classes at the center. We also validated this idea in the user testing sessions to make sure that teachers
                prefer to start the course right away when they use the app.</h4>
            <li class="subtitle">How do we encourage students to show their faces during the classes?</li>
            <h4>Another complaint from teachers about online teaching is that some students don't want to show their faces, and the teachers can't get immediate feedback from their gestures and reactions.

                <br><i style="font-weight:300;">'They joined the meeting, turned off the camera, and leave so they don't participate in the class.'</i> <br><br> We need to find a way to encourage the students to turn on their cameras and better engage
                with the classes. With the help of up-front secondary research we conducted, the team decided to create a virtual classroom feature for the app. <span class="highlight">The idea is to simulate the real scenario of students in the classroom by having everyone
                'sit' on the desk and have their faces showing up on a cartoon body.</span> The student who doesn't have their camera on will have a blank camera view. It aims to 'gamify' online class taking and encourage the kids to turn on their cameras.

            <h4>After discussion and research, we picked Option B since everyone is supposed to speak freely in the classroom setting, and the chances of using the 'reaction' feature are low. When users do need to give reactions, the scenario is when people
                are mute, and one or two students are talking. In this case, it makes more sense to make the reaction button easy to click while only taking a small piece of area.<br> <br>

                the center of the screen and give reactions to the students.</h4>

            <h4><b>After the user testing, we identified the following designs to be modified:</b><br><br>1) The current reaction users can be interpreted as given to the pinned speaker. The reaction feature in the classroom mode needs to be more precise
                about whom the reactions the users are giving to.<br><br>2) We can try to have the slideshow show in a small screen while having the students pinned at the center of the screen. It provides an even easier alternative to go back to the

            <h4>The overall user flow stays similar to the wireframes. I modified the design based on the feedbacks and created high-fidelity interfaces. I chose a complementary color combination - ‘green’ and ‘red’ to be the app’s primary color. Red is energizing
                and associated with strength and friendliness, while green is calming, soothing, and can bring down the excitement to an ideal level. </h4>

            <h4>Although I had no domain knowledge of the topic (teaching kids), research thoroughly on the products and users and gaining insights from users helped me carry out the design professionally within a short time. It was also great to collaborate
                with other designers and researchers. I learned a lot from different perspectives, honed the skill of articulating my design ideas and presenting them to other designers.

                <br><br>Based on our research, the overall user flow works well, and the team was pleased about it. If I had more time, I would spend more time doing the design iterations after the user testing and continue to work on the ‘reaction’ feature
                and make it more fun and kid-friendly. I would also like to design the student version of the app - it should be similar to the teacher’s version but simpler and has fewer buttons users need to click. The following steps for the team would
                be to test the new version of the app with students to gain valuable insight and continue iterating for an even more engaging experience.</h4>
